NAME
    CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI - a legacy-code-friendly PSGI adapter
    for CGI::Application

SYNOPSIS
    Create a PSGI application from a CGI::Application project:

        # if using CGI::Application
        my $psgi_app = CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            my $webapp = WebApp->new();
            $webapp->run();
        });

        # if using CGI::Application::Dispatch
        my $psgi_app = CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI->handler(sub {
            WebApp::Dispatch->dispatch();
        });

    See plackup for options for running a PSGI application.

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI allows a project based on
    CGI::Application to run as a PSGI application. Differences from
    CGI::Application::PSGI are:

    uses CGI.pm directly instead of CGI::PSGI
        CGI::Application::PSGI (that uses CGI::PSGI) does not support
        programs calling CGI.pm in func-style (like CGI::virtual_host()).
        CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI sets up environment variables so
        that code using CGI.pm will work. Both approaches explictly use
        CGI.pm as the query object.

    compatible with CGI::Application::Dispatch
        The interface of CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI is different from
        CGI::Application::PSGI, and is compatible with
        CGI::Application::Dispatch.

    headers are parsed and re-generated.
        This difference is in favor of CGI::Application::PSGI, which more
        directly generates the HTTP headers in PSGI format. This module
        requires additional processing: First CGI::Application builds the
        full response including the headers and body, then we parse the
        final result back into the header and body format called for by the
        PSGI spec.
